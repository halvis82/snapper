Convenient snipping tool with multiple features

Snapper is a snipping tool app that allows you to take a screenshot of a portion of the screen. It is started with a hotkey of your choice (default: 'PrintScreen'). Screenshots will be saved to the 'Pictures' folder (if enabled), and copied to clipboard. You can change settings in the tray/services menu (or the hidden Snapper_settings.ini file in Snapper's folder). After the screenshot is taken the image will show up as a separate window you can move around. It has multiple hotkeys:
- esc: Close
- s: Save as
- e: Edit
- Space: Toggle image sizes

How to install:
- Download Snapper.exe
- Put it in a folder
- Run it
