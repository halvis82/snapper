Screenshots will be saved to the 'Pictures' folder (if enabled), and copied to clipboard. You can change settings in the tray/services menu (or the hidden Snapper_settings.ini file in Snapper's folder). After the screenshot is taken the image will show up as a separate window you can move around. It has multiple hotkeys:`n- esc: Close`n- s: Save as`n- e: Edit`n- Space: Toggle image sizes
